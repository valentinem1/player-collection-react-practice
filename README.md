Hi Welcome to My NBA Player Collection!

This is just a practice lab that I made to practice my React Skills for my code challenge at my bootcamp.

First to start git fork && git clone that repo.

In your console fire npm install to install the react packages needed. cd into the repo in your console && npm start to fire the react server.

What you'll see on your browser is a really simple app(sorry for the styling it's not that cute, I mostly focus on the React functionality part of it for practice purposes).

The app already comes with the components needed, with some functionality working like displaying the players on the page. The state is already put in the right place. The only thing needed is to add the functions that would make the functionality listed below working.

Some of the call back functions etc... are already there as props and commented out.

What you should be able to do:
- See all the players that I added.
- Create a player and the player is added to the end of the list of players
- Like a player and the likes goes up

This lab is mostly focus on working on your functionality skills.

There is also a screen shot of the functionality down below so you know what to expect.

As I mentionned above this a really basic React App. I did not implement any fetching yet. So any player created or liked will not persist after refreshing the page.


Have fun!
